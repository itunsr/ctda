I feel a little regret, but not sad.
When I know that I love in my life is gone, the love I have in my life far away, so the deepest pain of my life is over, so, I no longer sad.
I can dry the tears, then bravely stood up and strive for tomorrow.
I think I was a strong woman in his bones, my world not despair.
So, tonight I also can enjoy the beauty of a summer night, once again put the crescent moon treasure in permanent memory.
I borrow the sun shining, gently nearby pond, never means without fish, abrupt way up, swam toward me, take the lead in a large red brocade carp your head above water, mix a mouth of vomit a bubble, two previous existence seems to meet the old in this world, eagerly.
